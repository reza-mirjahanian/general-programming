### Try Refactoring Instead writing new code
-   Refactor code that has unit tests — so you know what you have.
-   Start with the deepest point of your code — it will be easiest to refactor.
-   Test after refactoring — to make sure you didn’t break anything.
-   Have a safety net — e.g.,  [Continuous Integration]— so you can revert to a previous build.
