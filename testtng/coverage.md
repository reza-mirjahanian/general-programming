Code coverage is the percentage of code which is covered by automated tests. Code coverage measurement simply determines which statements in a body of code have been executed through a test run, and which statements have not. In general, a code coverage system collects information about the running program and then combines that with source information to generate a report on the test suite's code coverage.
