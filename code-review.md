### What to Look for in a Code Review
-   Do I understand what the code does?
-   Does the code function as I expect it to?
-   Does this code fulfill regulatory requirements?

### 2. Build and Test — Before Code Review
In today’s era of Continuous Integration (CI), it’s key to build and test before doing a manual review. Ideally, after tests have passed, you’ll conduct a review and deploy it to the dev codeline.

### 3. Don’t Review Code For Longer Than 60 Minutes

### 4. Check No More Than 400 Lines at a Time

If you try to review too many lines of code at once, you’re less likely to find defects.

### 5. Give Feedback That Helps (Not Hurts)
Try to be constructive in your feedback, rather than critical. You can do this by asking questions, rather than making statements. And remember to give praise alongside your constructive feedback.
