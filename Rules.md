## Law of Demeter
The _Law of Demeter (LoD)_ or _principle of least knowledge_ is a design guideline for developing software, particularly object-oriented programs.
Demeter’s law is known as “don’t talk to strangers” because:

1.  Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units — only units “closely” related to the current unit.
2.  Each unit should only talk to its friends —  _don’t talk to strangers_.
3.  Only talk to your immediate friends.
